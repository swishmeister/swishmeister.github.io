				<h2>About:</h2>
				<p>In this project, foundational SQL skills were put into action, starting with thorough data cleaning
					to address inconsistencies and outliers, ensuring a solid base for analysis. The integration of data
					from LastPitchRangers and RangersPitchingStats showcased adeptness in joining multiple datasets.
					Utilizing data transformation techniques, such as common table expressions and subqueries, the data
					was tailored for specific insights. Proficiency in aggregate functions was displayed by deriving key
					metrics, and comparative analyses highlighted contrasts between different data facets. The project
					culminated in detailed, player-specific evaluations, exemplifying the versatility and depth of the
					SQL analyses undertaken. For a detailed look at the full code, please visit my GitHub Repository
					linked above. </p>

				<h2> 1. Introduction to the Data Landscape:
				</h2>
				<p> At the beginning of our expedition, we first acquaint ourselves with the primary datasets -
					LastPitchRangers and RangersPitchingStats. By viewing the entirety of these datasets, we lay the
					groundwork, giving us a panoramic view of the data we're about to dive deep into.</p>

				<h2>2. The Art of Averaging:
				</h2>
				<p>Our journey then meanders into understanding the average nuances of the game. We start by calculating
					the average number of pitches per at-bat. This exploration branches into a comparison between home
					and
					away games, giving us insights into how familiar turf might influence the game. The analysis further
					bifurcates, comparing lefty vs. righty batters, revealing potential strategies or biases. We wrap up
					this segment by delving into specific pitchers, focusing on those with more than 20 innings,
					highlighting the veterans of the game.

				<h2>3. Decoding Pitch Preferences:
				</h2>
				<p>As we drift further, we plunge into the realm of pitch preferences. Which pitches do players favor
					during the initial at-bats? This segment uncovers the top 3 most common pitches for the first ten
					at-bats, potentially revealing early-game strategies or pitcher comfort zones.

				<h2>4. The Intricacies of the Last Pitch:</h2>
				<P>Our journey takes a twist, focusing on the climax of each at-bat - the last pitch. We count these
					final throws, categorizing them into fastball and offspeed. This dissection might reveal if pitchers
					prefer power or deception when it all comes down to the wire. Furthermore, the percentages provide a
					clearer picture of this balance.</P>

				<img src="images/part4.4.png">
				<h2>5. The Home Run Chronicles:</h2>
				<P>We then venture into the thrilling domain of home runs. What kind of pitches often result in these
					game-changing moments? By breaking down home runs by pitch type, location, and the ball-strike
					count, we unearth patterns that might be critical in future games. This segment is pivotal,
					focusing on moments that can turn the tide in any match.

					<img src="images/part5.4.png">

					<h2>6. Player Spotlight - Pérez, Martín:</h2>
					<p>Our narrative then zooms in on specific players, notably 'Pérez, Martín'. By analyzing pitch
						zones tailored to individual players, we get a microscopic view, understanding player-specific
						strategies or weaknesses.</p>
					<img src="images/part6.png">
					<img src="images/part6.1.png">
					<img src="images/part6.2.png">

					<h2>7. The Nuanced Metrics:</h2>
					<p>As our journey nears its conclusion, we dive into other intricate metrics like release speed,
						spin
						rate,
						and more. This segment offers a balanced mix of power, precision, and strategy, painting a vivid
						picture
						of the pitcher's arsenal.</p>
					<img src="images/part6.3.png">
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<P>In this meticulously crafted analysis, we journeyed through the intricate tapestry of pitching
						strategies, uncovering invaluable insights that redefine the understanding of the game. By
						diving into the nuances of average pitches, deciphering pitch preferences, and spotlighting
						critical moments
						like home runs, the project illuminates the complex interplay of strategy, psychology, and raw
						skill
						on the baseball field. The focused analysis on specific players, such as 'Pérez, Martín',
						underscores
						the importance of tailored strategies in modern baseball. As a conclusion, this project not only
						offers a data-driven lens to view the sport but also emphasizes the profound impact of informed
						decision-making in turning the tide of any match.</P>
					<p>This SQL project, in essence, is a comprehensive exploration into the art and science of
						pitching. Each query, each segment, stitches together to form a tapestry that showcases the
						strategy,
						skill, and suspense of the game. From broad strokes to fine details, the project is a testament
						to the
						depth and beauty of baseball analysis.</p>

			<h1>Path of Exile Currency Visualization</h1>
			<h2>About the Project:</h2>
			<p>In the dynamic and expansive universe of "Path of Exile" (PoE), in-game currency plays a pivotal role,
				with its value fluctuating based on myriad in-game and community factors. Recognizing the need for a
				comprehensive view of these fluctuations, I embarked on a journey to create an interactive dashboard
				leveraging the rich data available from the Path of Exile API.</p>
			<iframe title="Poe_Currency_Visualization_Final" width="1000" height="580.25"
				src="https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=ec707fe9-3ceb-4727-ae9f-caab117a6b1f&autoAuth=true&ctid=e894b432-bf45-48c8-940b-65d4f8915401"

					The data was meticulously extracted, cleaned, and processed to ensure accuracy and relevance.</p>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>In conclusion, this project was a harmonious blend of my passion for gaming and expertise in
					financial data analytics. It stands as a testament to the power of data visualization in making
					complex data sets comprehensible, actionable, and engaging. Whether you are a PoE enthusiast or a
					data aficionado, this dashboard promises to offer valuable insights and a intuitive user
					experience.</p>
